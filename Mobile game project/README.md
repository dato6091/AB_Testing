# A/B Test Analysis Projects
This repository contains my study and analysis of an A/B test cases, aimed at practicing various skills related to experimental data analysis, statistical testing, and result communication. The study is conducted in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks to structure and present the analyses.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
* Practice analyzing A/B test experiments.
* Perform statistical tests and calculate confidence intervals.
* Effectively communicate A/B test results.

## Project Overview

### Gate Position Change in Cookie Cats (Mobile Game)

#### Goal:
To evaluate the impact of moving the first gate in the game from level 30 to level 40 on player retention and engagement. The study aims to measure how this change affects the number of game rounds played and player retention on the first and seventh day post-installation.

#### Analysis Process:
* Identify the target metric.
* Aggregate data and calculate proportions of variants.
* Estimate the treatment effect and confidence intervals.
* Use bootstrap resampling to compare confidence intervals with analytical methods.
* Conduct statistical tests.
* Give recommendations based on the results.
  
#### Outcome:
Recommend whether the new gate position improves player engagement and retention or whether the previous position should be retained.
