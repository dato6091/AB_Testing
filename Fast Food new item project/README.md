# A/B Test Analysis Projects
This repository contains my study and analysis of an A/B test cases, aimed at practicing various skills related to experimental data analysis, statistical testing, and result communication. The study is conducted in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks to structure and present the analyses.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
* Practice analyzing A/B test experiments.
* Perform statistical tests and calculate confidence intervals.
* Effectively communicate A/B test results.
* Create dashboards to visualize and interpret findings.

## Project Overview

### Marketing Campaign for a New Menu Item (Fast-Food Chain)

#### Goal:
To determine which of three different marketing campaigns is most effective in increasing sales of a new menu item during its initial four weeks on the market. Weekly sales data from multiple markets is analyzed to identify the best-performing promotion.

#### Analysis Process:
* Identify the target metric.
* Aggregate data and calculate proportions of variants.
* Estimate the treatment effect and confidence intervals.
* Conduct statistical tests.
* Give recommendations based on the results.
  
#### Outcome:
Provide actionable recommendations on which marketing campaign maximizes sales.
Create a dashboard to see the evolution of the target metric during the experiment: [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.torrej.n.pujol/viz/FastFoodDashboard_17316759550250/DashboardHome?publish=yes](https://public.tableau.com/views/FastFoodDashboard_17316759550250/DashboardHome?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
