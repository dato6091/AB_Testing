# A/B Test Analysis for Fast-Food Marketing Campaign

## Overview

This project analyzes an A/B test conducted for a fast-food chain to determine the most effective promotional strategy for introducing a new menu item. The test compares three marketing campaigns to identify which generates the highest average revenue per location.

## Dataset

The dataset contains sales and campaign-related data, with key columns:
- **MarketID**: Unique identifier for the market.
- **MarketSize**: Size category of the market (e.g., small, medium, large).
- **LocationID**: Unique identifier for the location.
- **AgeOfStore**: Age of the store in years.
- **Promotion**: Campaign strategy identifier (1, 2, or 3).
- **Week**: Week of the experiment.
- **SalesInThousands**: Weekly sales in thousands.

## Objectives

1. Compare the revenue generated by each promotion group.
2. Test statistical assumptions for ANOVA.
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the promotional strategies using post-hoc tests.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Data was grouped by promotion to calculate average and median sales per promotion.
- Visualizations such as histograms and Q-Q plots were created to examine the distribution of sales.

### 2. Assumption Testing
- **Normality Check**: Histograms and Q-Q plots revealed deviations from normality in sales data.
- **Homogeneity of Variance**: Levene's test confirmed that variances across promotion groups are not significantly different.

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **ANOVA Test**: Conducted to identify overall differences between promotion groups.
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA for comparing group medians.
- **Post-Hoc Analysis**: Tukey's HSD and Dunn's test used to pinpoint specific differences between groups.

## Key Findings

- Promotions 1 and 3 significantly outperform Promotion 2.
- No statistically significant difference was found between Promotions 1 and 3.
- Median sales analysis reinforced these findings, with Promotions 1 and 3 showing similar performance.

## Visualizations

The project includes:
- Histograms and Q-Q plots for sales distributions.
- Statistical summaries for mean and median comparisons.
- Tukey's HSD and Dunn's test results in tabular format.

## Conclusion

- Promotions 1 and 3 are the top-performing campaigns.
- If further testing is required, focus on comparing Promotions 1 and 3 to identify subtle differences.
- For immediate implementation, Promotion 1 is recommended for its comparable performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9 or later
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-posthocs`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`AB_Test_FastFood_Marketing.ipynb`).
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Future Work

- Investigate potential seasonality or external factors influencing sales.
- Extend the experiment duration for more conclusive results between Promotions 1 and 3.
- Apply advanced machine learning models to predict campaign performance.
